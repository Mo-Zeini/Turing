# Turing
This application creates a window containinga graphical representation of the tape with an arrow pointing to the current cell using Swing GUI Java.

There are buttons for moving the current cell to the left and to the right.

A text-input box shows the content of the current cell.

This box can be edited, and there is a "Set" button that copies the contents of the cell (actually just the first character) to the current cell.
